    "### What is Parallelization in langGraph ? \n",
    "\n",
    "In langGraph, nodes typically execute in a sequence defined by edges, but when tasks don't depend on each other's output, you can run them in parallel. this is achieved by : \n",
    "\n",
    "- Defining multiple nodes that can operate independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- connecting them to a common starting point (to START or other nodes )\n",
    "\n",
    "- merging their outputs into a downstream node if needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph handles this implicitly when nodes are independent and can leverage multi-threading or asynchronous execution under the hood, depending on the runtime envionment( eg. python's asyncio or a multi-threaded executor.)\n",
