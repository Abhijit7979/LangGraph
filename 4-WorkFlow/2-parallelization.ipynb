    "\n",
    "In langGraph, nodes typically execute in a sequence defined by edges, but when tasks don't depend on each other's output, you can run them in parallel. this is achieved by : \n",

    "LangGraph handles this implicitly when nodes are independent and can leverage multi-threading or asynchronous execution under the hood, depending on the runtime envionment( eg. python's asyncio or a multi-threaded executor.)\n",
